Optimal Dispatch Model for Industrial Energy Communities with Closed Electrical Distribution Systems
According to the European Directive 2019/944/CE, industry energy communities (IEC) and their power generation assets, integrated in parks in a specific area or municipality, can operate their own closed distribution network (CDS). This implies a new paradigm that requires the development of a new power dispatch model different from the one traditionally applied by the Distribution System Operator (DSO) in Open-Access Distribution Systems (OADS). This paper proposes an innovative optimal active and reactive power dispatch model for DSO industrial energy communities (DSO-IEC) for maximum social welfare conditions. Different energy community actors, such as local electricity producers with battery energy storage systems (BESS) and industrial loads with demand response, are connected to a CDS. As a key contribution, a remuneration framework based on Distribution Locational Marginal Pricing (D-LMP) is applied according to the ongoing smart grid paradigm. BESS scheduling and generation/demand dispatch are determined for the maximum community's social welfare condition with and without the reactive power capability of energy producers: renewable generators and BESS. The model has been applied to a case study in Spain. Results show the importance of providing adequate reactive power support in CDS in order to obtain grid voltage stability, minimize active losses, and maximize the community's profits
